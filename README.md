# AWS Projects

## üìÅ Repository Overview

This repository contains a collection of AWS projects built for learning and hands-on practice. The projects explore different AWS services using technologies like Flask, Bulma, Alpine.js, and Angular.

Each project lives in its own branch, and you‚Äôll find a short overview of what each one does below.

## Project 1 - Launching an EC2 Instance

This project walks through launching an EC2 instance and setting it up with Nginx as a web server.
The server displays key instance details ‚Äî such as the instance ID, type, and region ‚Äî to give a simple, practical look at AWS compute and deployment basics.


## Project 2 - Creating a CRUD Application with Lambda & DynamoDB

In this project, we use AWS Lambda and DynamoDB to build a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application.
You‚Äôll also learn how to provision the infrastructure using the AWS CLI, giving you hands-on experience with serverless architecture and infrastructure-as-code concepts.
