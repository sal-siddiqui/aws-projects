# AWS Projects

## Project 2

## 📝 Branch Overview

In this project, we use AWS Lambda and DynamoDB to build a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application.
You’ll also learn how to provision the infrastructure using the AWS CLI, giving you hands-on experience with serverless architecture and infrastructure-as-code concepts.
